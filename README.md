# Custom keyboard

This keyboard is based on the `Sweep Half Swept` keyboard.

Some of the modifications I did:

- Removed reset button
- Modified PCB shape
- Rerouted most of tracks 
- Solved many CRC warnings (many still there)

Once I have the first prototype and I'm used to using a 36 key I'll improve on the design.

Main features missing:

- Hot-swappable connectors
- Wireless controler Nano!
- Custom shape to my hand
- Wooden case
